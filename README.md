# AIS Vessel Trajectory Prediction


AIS (Automatic Identification System) data provides real-time information about a vessel's position, speed, and course, among others. AIS is essential for navigation and collision avoidance, maritime traffic monitoring, and environmental protection.

Objective: Given AIS data from 1st January to 7th May 2024, predict the future positions of vessels at given timestamps for five days into the future.
